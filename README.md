# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
I was bored so I made a little project to practice my python skills

# game mechanics were simple  
but I had a lot of errors with my win checking algorithm and have tried a few different solutions ranging from:
\n-manually entering the win position permutations in an array and looping over these positions after every move
\n-Using a nested for loop to check through contiguous win positions in the 3*3 grid
